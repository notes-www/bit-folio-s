If a solvable problem has been unsolved by the problem-solving community for an extended period of time, then the something that is being overlooked is either infrequently noticed or never-before noticed (i.e., obscure). Further, we will call all somethings that can be either noticed or unnoticed features. \\u2028\\u2028Based on this reasoning, the OFH, originally presented in McCaffrey (2012), can be stated as follows: all innovative solutions to a problem are built upon at least one obscure feature of the problem. The OFH approach leads to a systematic derivation of innovation-enhancing techniques by following these steps: articulate a wide panoply of possible types of features, disclose why humans tend to overlook certain features types, and construct techniques to help humans unearth the obscure members of these feature types.","targetRectangle":{"y":341.25614309310913,"x":1615.2579588890076,"width":209.19000000000005,"height":634.81827632269778}},{"text":"OBSERVATIONS","targetRectangle":{"y":954.66628408432007,"x":102.97524404525757,"width":144.0234375,"height":24}},{"text":"Optimization tools are imposed as efficiency and technical validity tools, not as creative components of a design process. \\u2028\\u2028There is a fundamental issue with the design philosophy.","targetRectangle":{"y":314.83229970932007,"x":102.97524404525757,"width":1234.7950038757922,"height":537.57246595375}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"95949C1AC625CDC9DAE0B2BAEC77B459"}]}]}}]}} )
